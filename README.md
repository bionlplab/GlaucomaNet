# GlaucomaNet
A deep-learning algorithm for the diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma from fundus photographs


Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness in the United States and worldwide. Although deep learning methods have been proposed to diagnose POAG, these methods all used a single image as input. Differently, the glaucoma specialists compare the follow-up image with the baseline image to determine a glaucomatous eye. To simulate this process, we proposed a siamese network model, POAGNet, to identify POAG from fundus photographs
